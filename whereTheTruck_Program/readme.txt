In the folder, supposoe to be 3 files- folder that contains the program files, readme.txt (this), and a .jar file.
Open the jar file, "WhereTheTrack-xx.jar".
you can open the file only on a comuter that running java.
fill the username and password fields, Pay attention for Unnecessary spaces. 
Then click "start". 
Every 25 minutes the program will log in again. It's important to keep the computer on and connected to the internet to allow access to wherethetruck.at
You don't need to re-fill your details or click start again. From the moment you clicked "start" the program will keep log in and out every 25 minutes without your intervention. (as long as the program is open) 

If "incurrect" message show in the log, the username/ password don't match.

If an error message shows up, the best thing to do is close and reopen the program before reactive.

The safest way to stop the program, is click on "stop" few minutes after the last "logged-in" message  (NOT when "working..." message displayed on screen), then wait for the button releas (when the text change back to" start") and only then- close the program.
